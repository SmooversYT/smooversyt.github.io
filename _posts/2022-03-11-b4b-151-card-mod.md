Howdy Smoovers, and thanks for showing interest in our first public Back 4 Blood mod!

We've been hard at work behind the scenes testing and figuring things out so that we can reinvigorate Back 4 Blood.

This first mod allows you to take a deck of 151 cards. Why 151 cards, you ask? Well, when I went into the game to see how many cards there were, I accidentally went into Campaign mode instead of Training mode, which means I didn't see any of the cards unlocked by achievements... But besides that, as Cam has pointed out, many of the cards are mutually exclusive, so hopefully you'll get by :P

Here's our video showcasing the mod and what it can do:

And [here's the download](https://smooversyt.github.io/b4bmod-151cards.zip). 
To install:
1. Locate your Back 4 Blood install directory. You can do this on Steam by right-clicking Back 4 Blood on the left side of your library and clicking Manage > Browse Local Files.
2. Navigate to /Back 4 Blood/Gobi/Content/Paks.
3. Extract your downloaded zip file into the Paks folder.

Have fun! 

Remember: this mod is designed to be used offline. We do not endorse using this mod during online play.

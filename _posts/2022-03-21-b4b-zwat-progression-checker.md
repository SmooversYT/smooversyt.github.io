Howdy all! In the process of modding Back 4 Blood, I happened to stumble upon a way to check save files, including all of the missions you've ever completed.

So, here's a new program that will tell you how close you are to your ZWAT skin! Just double-click the program and enter what character you're curious about and it'll tell you what levels you still need to complete. If you don't see a window pop up, you may need to install Java first - https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/

This is an external tool that currently only works with the Steam version of the game, but let me know if there are EGS players who'd also like to use this tool. As with the mods, I still haven't figured out a way to crack into the Xbox Game App unfortunately.

Anyway, [here's the download](https://smooversyt.github.io/downloads/CheckZWATProgression.jar).

Good luck on all your ZWATs!

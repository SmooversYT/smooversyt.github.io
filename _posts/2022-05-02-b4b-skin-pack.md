Howdy Smoovers, long time no see! ... Well, you've seen me, but not here...

In any case, we're back! I've had requests to upload the mods Cam has been messing around with on stream, so we're following through on that promise. Here is the first of many mods to come, which is the very first texture mod we showed off on the channel. It's been updated to work in the most recent patch, but doesn't have skin for Heng or Sharice yet unfortunately.

Here's Cam's showcase of the skins:

And [here's the download](https://smooversyt.github.io/downloads/b4bmod-skinpack1.zip). 
To install:
1. Locate your Back 4 Blood install directory. You can do this on Steam by right-clicking Back 4 Blood on the left side of your library and clicking Manage > Browse Local Files.
2. Navigate to /Back 4 Blood/Gobi/Content/Paks.
3. Extract your downloaded zip file into the Paks folder.

The good news is that this mod does work online, so you don't need to disable it to play with others and in fact I'd encourage you to play with other friends that have this mod installed as well.

The bad news is that the skins will only appear for players who have this mod installed, so if you go online, you'll look to your teammates like you're wearing the default outfit.

Hope you guys enjoy :)

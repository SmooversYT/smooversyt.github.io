Back again so soon? It's like Christmas!

In the past few days, I've been working on some tools for cataloguing and taking pictures of maps in game, so I'm going to make those available to you guys as well.

There are three mods altogether:
- The first mod lets you jump really high and float down slowly, giving a good vantage point for overhead shots.
- The second mod disables the in-game HUD, allowing for a pristine picture \(just make sure you take the screenshot while switching weapons!\)
- The third mod makes your flashlight super bright to light up those dark scenes.

Here's what can be done with these mods:


Download the high jump mod [here](https://smooversyt.github.io/downloads/b4bmod-high-jump.zip). 
Download the no HUD mod [here](https://smooversyt.github.io/downloads/b4bmod-no-hud.zip). 
Download the intense flashlight mod [here](https://smooversyt.github.io/downloads/b4bmod-bright-flashlight.zip). 

To install:
1. Locate your Back 4 Blood install directory. You can do this on Steam by right-clicking Back 4 Blood on the left side of your library and clicking Manage > Browse Local Files.
2. Navigate to /Back 4 Blood/Gobi/Content/Paks.
3. Extract your downloaded zip file into the Paks folder.

The high jump mod and flashlight mods don't work online, but the no HUD mod does, so feel free to do a No HUD No Hope run like me and Cam :)

Have fun!

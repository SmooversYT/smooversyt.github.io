Welcome to day 3 of what I have just establish will be a full week of mods!

Today's mod is the free tenderizer mod. Now, the way this mod works is that if you drop a piece of copper, it turns into a tenderizer instead. \(Also, you only drop one copper at a time, so don't worry about wasting all your cash.\)

Now, most mods we've uploaded don't affect multiplayer gameplay, but in fact, the one thing that *does* carry over into multiplayer is your save file. Thus, we discovered the following method for transferring these tenderizers into multiplayer:
1. Start a fresh unmodded campaign run with 4 people connected.
2. Have everyone die and use a continue.
3. Leave the game.
4. Install the mod.
5. Reload the run in offline solo.
6. Give all of the bots tenderizers as we've outlined on the channel previously.
7. Complete the level.
8. Uninstall the mod.
9. Reconnect to online.
10. Start the same run with the same 4 people.

You should all load back in with the bots' loadouts. Unfortunately, you do have to start on level 2, but one helpful thing I've found is that on 1-1, if you jump into the pit in the construction site instead of getting downed, it doesn't waste a life. This is useful on No Hope difficulty where you don't regenerate lives in between levels.

Here's a video of us playing with this mod on stream:

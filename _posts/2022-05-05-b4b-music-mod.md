Day 4 is here and I'm already regretting promising something for tomorrow...

Today's mod is the jukebox mod, debuted a bit ago for a split second on stream. Just a silly little mod that changes the music of the jukebox.

Download the mod [here](https://smooversyt.github.io/downloads/b4bmod-music.zip).

To install:
1. Locate your Back 4 Blood install directory. You can do this on Steam by right-clicking Back 4 Blood on the left side of your library and clicking Manage > Browse Local Files.
2. Navigate to /Back 4 Blood/Gobi/Content/Paks.
3. Extract your downloaded zip file into the Paks folder.

Come back tomorrow for something that may or may not be cool idk lmao

Finally, day 5 of my week of mods has come, and I shall not disappoint. No, my friend, this is no Byleth. This is a Sora.

Today, we have the first ever model swap mod for Back 4 Blood, and how fitting it is...

I present: Smoover Evangelo!

How's that for something to work towards? Better start getting those totems!

Download the mod [here](https://smooversyt.github.io/downloads/b4bmod-smoover-evan.zip).

To install:
1. Locate your Back 4 Blood install directory. You can do this on Steam by right-clicking Back 4 Blood on the left side of your library and clicking Manage > Browse Local Files.
2. Navigate to /Back 4 Blood/Gobi/Content/Paks.
3. Extract your downloaded zip file into the Paks folder.

Have fun playing as an honorary member of the Smoovers!

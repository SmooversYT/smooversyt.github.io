After many weeks of work, I've managed to boil down the manual vertex editing of Smoover Evangelo into a true model swap.

Here's my first full product!

Looking towards the future, I think we've unlocked much of the potential of full model swaps. There's still a little bit left to be done, namely model swaps of characters themselves, but as far as static meshes go, we're there.

Download the mod [here](https://smooversyt.github.io/downloads/b4bmod-amongusmedkit.zip).

To install:
1. Locate your Back 4 Blood install directory. You can do this on Steam by right-clicking Back 4 Blood on the left side of your library and clicking Manage > Browse Local Files.
2. Navigate to /Back 4 Blood/Gobi/Content/Paks.
3. Extract your downloaded zip file into the Paks folder.

Have fun!

Model swaps flooding in!

For whatever reason, I can't get the 50 and 100 piles to look any different, so I'm content with these for now.

Download the mod [here](https://smooversyt.github.io/downloads/b4bmod-gift-copper.zip).

To install:
1. Locate your Back 4 Blood install directory. You can do this on Steam by right-clicking Back 4 Blood on the left side of your library and clicking Manage > Browse Local Files.
2. Navigate to /Back 4 Blood/Gobi/Content/Paks.
3. Extract your downloaded zip file into the Paks folder.

Have fun!

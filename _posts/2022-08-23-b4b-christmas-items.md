Missed out on the holiday cosmetics? Bought the game too late? Just want to fill out your cosmetics?

We got you covered!

This mod puts the holiday cosmetics into the totem supply lines. They have their original supply point costs, but you've got to get through the totem burn cards to get there. Time to get grinding again!

Download the mod [here](https://smooversyt.github.io/downloads/b4bmod-buy-christmas-stuff.zip).

Couple of notes:
- You will have to finish whatever totem supply line you currently have waiting for you for the items to appear in the next one.
- If you don't have all totem cosmetics unlocked, you may still get those in your supply line instead, in which case you'll have to try again on the next one!
- I haven't tested the purchasing online, so I would recommend only using the mod offline. Then, once you have your cosmetics purchased, uninstall the mod and go online. They'll still be attached to your save and you'll be able to still use them once you go online.

To install:
1. Locate your Back 4 Blood install directory. You can do this on Steam by right-clicking Back 4 Blood on the left side of your library and clicking Manage > Browse Local Files.
2. Navigate to /Back 4 Blood/Gobi/Content/Paks.
3. Extract your downloaded zip file into the Paks folder.

Have fun!

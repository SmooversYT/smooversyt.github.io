When we found out how badly broken duffel bags were, I swore I'd figure out a way to get those cards into your decks.

Well, it's a little bit of a convoluted route, but it's the first one I found.

Download the mod [here](https://smooversyt.github.io/downloads/b4bmod-dlc2-cards.zip).

This mod doesn't exactly *unlock* the new cards for you... but it does let you put them in your decks. In short, it replaces existing cards in the menu UI, so when you save your deck, it persists even after you uninstall the mod.

To build a deck with the new cards:
- Install the mod.
- In offline mode, create a new deck containing only those of the new cards you want to use.
- Save the deck.
- Uninstall the mod.
- In online mode this time, edit the deck, *making sure not to remove the already existing cards*. You should now be able to add any existing cards.
- Play the game. :)

To install:
1. Locate your Back 4 Blood install directory. You can do this on Steam by right-clicking Back 4 Blood on the left side of your library and clicking Manage > Browse Local Files.
2. Navigate to /Back 4 Blood/Gobi/Content/Paks.
3. Extract your downloaded zip file into the Paks folder.

Have fun!

Straight from chat suggestions, I've turned bear traps into piles of legos. You won't want to step on these guys!

Also worth noting is that the folded bear traps you can pick up are instead a tower of legos for you to pick up and lay down as a trap hehe

Download the mod [here](https://smooversyt.github.io/downloads/b4bmod-lego-bear-trap.zip).

To install:
1. Locate your Back 4 Blood install directory. You can do this on Steam by right-clicking Back 4 Blood on the left side of your library and clicking Manage > Browse Local Files.
2. Navigate to /Back 4 Blood/Gobi/Content/Paks.
3. Extract your downloaded zip file into the Paks folder.

Have fun!
